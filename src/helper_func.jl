    _point_check(p::Union{StaticVector{2,Float64}, Point2, Tuple{Float64,Float64}}) -> Tuple{Float64,Float64}

Checks the validity of the given point `p` in terms of latitude (LAT) and longitude (LON) values. The function expects the input to be in radians and within the valid range for LAT and LON. If you want to pass numbers in degrees, consider using `°` from Unitful (Also re-exported by TelecomUtils) by doing `x * °`.

## Arguments
- `p`: A tuple representing a point on the globe where the first element is the latitude (LAT) and the second element is the longitude (LON).

## Returns
- A tuple with the longitude and latitude values converted to radians.

    CountriesBorders.extract_countries(r::GeoRegion)

Extracts the countries from a given region.

It first gets the field names of the `GeoRegion` type, excluding the `:regionName`, then maps these field names to their corresponding values in the `GeoRegion` instance `r`, creating a collection of pairs. It filters out any pairs where the value is empty. It converts this collection of pairs into a `NamedTuple`, finally, it calls `CountriesBorders.extract_countries` with the `NamedTuple` as keyword arguments.

This function is an overload of `CountriesBorders.extract_countries` that takes a `GeoRegion` object as input. It extracts the countries from the given region and returns them.

## Arguments
- `r::GeoRegion`: The region from which to extract the countries. It should be an instance of the `GeoRegion` type.

## Returns
- The function returns the result of `CountriesBorders.extract_countries(;kwargs...)`.
