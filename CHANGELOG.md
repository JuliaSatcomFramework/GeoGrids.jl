## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added a functionality to deal with polygons crossing the antimeridian (180Â° longitude), especially in the context of ofsetting regions. The implementation is based on the implementation in the python library at https://github.com/gadomski/antimeridian, though it's simplified to only work on a subset of cases for the moment.

### Changed
- The `borders` is now the one defined in `CountriesBorders.jl` and is simply extended in GeoGrids (instead of replacing it with a local function of the same name)
